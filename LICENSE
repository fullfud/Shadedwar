Copyright (c) 2025 fullfud

Permission is granted to download, build, and use the Fullfud Shahed mod solely for personal gameplay or for non-commercial servers whose total income does not exceed the actual out-of-pocket cost of hosting infrastructure, provided that any monetary support granted to such servers is purely voluntary and delivers no in-game or out-of-game consideration to the donor other than acknowledgment. Any other monetisation – including, but not limited to, sales of ranks, items, cosmetic advantages, access passes, paid queue priority, sponsorship placements, advertising inventory, subscription models, or bundled content – is strictly prohibited without prior written consent from fullfud.

Redistribution of binary or source copies is permitted only if (1) this notice is included unchanged, (2) no fees are charged except unavoidable file-hosting charges that cannot exceed actual bandwidth expenses, and (3) recipients are clearly informed of the above non-commercial limitation before download.

Derivative works (including ports, forks, and translations) are allowed only when the resulting project inherits this licence verbatim and prominently credits “Fullfud Shahed Mod by fullfud”. Any change to gameplay, assets, or code does not waive or diminish fullfud’s ownership rights.

Full commercial rights, sublicensing, or integration into monetised modpacks, launchers, clients, or services are reserved exclusively to fullfud. The only standing exception is the FrontlineMC server network, which is granted a perpetual, worldwide, non-transferable, non-sublicensable licence to use, modify, and distribute the mod (and derivative builds) within its own infrastructure, including monetised offerings, subject to maintaining attribution to fullfud.

Any party that violates these terms automatically loses all rights granted herein and must remove the software from its systems within seven calendar days of receiving written notice. Rights may be reinstated only through a new written licence issued by fullfud.
